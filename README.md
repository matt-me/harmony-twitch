===============

A firefox extension to analyze local twitch chat.

Why?
=====

Twitch chatrooms can get pretty hectic. It's sometimes hard to see what's being said, especially with the window scrolling so much and the varying length of usernames being displayed. This extension tries to obtain a 'crowd consensus' on the recent chat messages. It will identify certain words, phrases and emotes and make them more visible depending on their frequency.

Installation
============

This plugin is in development and I cannot provide an installation guide at this time. If you truly want to use it, then simply clone this repository, and in the firefox address bar go to: "about:debug" and load the extension temporarily.
